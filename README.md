This repo contains R, Python, and MATLAB files used in baseball research. The focus of the research was primarly ivestigating the "third time through the order" penalty for major league pitchers. The primary algorithm and theory used in this research is the Hidden Markov Model. 

The "data analysis" folder contains R files for scrapping the data and all exploratory analysis to find strike out ratio, batting avg, etc. 

The HMM and pbp folder contains Python and MATLAB files implementing the Hidden Markov Model for modeling of the pitcher's states during a given game. The Python version of the HMM is not coded to efficiency. At this point in research, I was only proficient in MATLAB and coded the HMM in Python as a learning exercise.
